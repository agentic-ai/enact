    "# Generic Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Poetry Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how enact's rewind / replay functionality can be used\n",
    "to search the space of executions of a python program. This allows us\n",
    "to implement advanced algorithms such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "in a problem-independent manner: MCTS just becomes a particular way in which\n",
    "we want to explore the search space of the scaffolding program.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate using an MCTS-style tree search using a line-by-line rhyming\n",
    "poetry generator: Rhyming poetry can be viewed as a planning problem, since a\n",
    "bad choice for a rhyme word earlier in the poem can make it difficult to find\n",
    "decent completions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can model line-by-line poetry generation via the following scaffolding program:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def extend_line(poem_so_far: str) -> str:\n",
    "  ... # Calls LLM to extend the poem by a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate_poem() -> str:\n",
    "  poem = ''\n",
    "  for _ in range(N_LINES):\n",
    "    poem = extend_line(poem)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Enact allows us to write algorithms that search the space of executions of a\n",
    "scaffolding program such as `generate_poem`. For example, if we want to generate\n",
    "different last lines for a single poem, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "invocation = enact.invoke(generate_poem)  # Generate initial poem\n",
    "full_poems = [invocation.get_output()]\n",
    "for _ in range(N):\n",
    "  variant = invocation.rewind().replay()  # Reroll the last the extend_line call\n",
    "  full_poems.append(variant.get_output())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this notebook shows how enact can be used to implement a generic\n",
    "Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that works for any scaffolding program, based on the\n",
    "same principle: By directly searching the tree of executions of the scaffolding\n",
    "program using enact's `rewind` and `replay` functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MCTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte-carlo tree search (MCTS) is a search algorithm that uses a critic to focus\n",
    "effort on high-scoring areas of the search space. When applied to line-by-line\n",
    "poetry generation, MCTS will generate a set of complete seed poems. In each\n",
    "search step, it will pick a prefix of a previously completed poem and generate\n",
    "a fresh completion. MCTS will optimistically choose prefixes that do not have\n",
    "many completions or prefixes that lead to high-scoring completions on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MCTS](mcts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the (made up) example above, we start with two seed poems, one terrible and one\n",
    "mediocre. MCTS chooses to regenerate a new last line for the mediocre poem, since it\n",
    "seems more promising than the terrible poem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of enact, we can view MCTS as choosing to rewind and replay the invocation\n",
    "of the second poem.\n"
